I have never understood the custom keyboard community... Why would you spend so much time and effort to have a special keyboard?
Wouldn't it just make it harder when getting to a regular keyboard and make yourself tied up?

**...Only to now find myself in this maze of split keyboard with custom bindings and what not!**

Let me share why I did this 180 and how I took the plunge and also (started to) get productive in this new area!
This is somewhat of a different blog from what I have usually done, but thought it would make some curious into taking the same route and also
be a help in getting started.

# Reasoning on starting
Just like with everything, you get influenced by people around you...

I have the fortune to work with a bunch of great individuals where we constantly share experiences and ideas. When we stumbled upon a problem of some sort during the day, the chance is high that someone researched it and came up with a solution proposal or maybe created an open source tool which for the general problem at hand.

I'll tell you why...

**Because our team nurtures a culture of constantly improving each other and what we do!** As a part of that, we spur each other in exploring areas just like custom keyboards, since it is an area which has a good chance of having a positive impact.

At this point I had started my journey towards **Vim** (or rather **Neovim**). While I felt that the concept of ditching the mouse in
favor of moving around with powerful bindings, there was a feeling that I had trouble touch-typing characters that were farther from homerow.
Didn't think too much about it, but did get a cheap 60% keyboard from Amazon to be able to focus more on the keys near homerow.

We discussed keyboards since there was an event coming up and our new member had gotten a Glove80 not long ago. The question about price did of course come up at this point and I hadn't been willing to make any particular investment before, which I stated. One of the replies sounded something like this:

***"I'm using my keyboard 8h a day. Investing in a keyboard is a no-brainer for me!"***

That evening I made the decision that I would need to
