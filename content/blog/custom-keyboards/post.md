I have never understood the custom keyboard community... Why would you spend so much time and effort to have a special keyboard?
Wouldn't it just make it harder when getting to a regular keyboard and make yourself tied up?

**...Only to now find myself in this maze of split keyboard with custom bindings and what not!**

Let me share why I did this 180 and how I took the plunge and also (started to) get productive in this new area!
This is somewhat of a different blog from what I have usually done, but thought it would make some curious into taking the same route and also
be a help in getting started.

# Reasoning on starting
Just like with everything, you get influenced by people around you...

I have the fortune to work with a bunch of great individuals where we constantly share experiences and ideas. When we stumbled upon a problem of some sort during the day, the chance is high that someone researched it and came up with a solution proposal or maybe created an open source tool which for the general problem at hand.

**What does this have to do with anything about keyboards?** ðŸ¤”

I'll tell you why...

**Because our team nurtures a culture of constantly improving each other and what we do!** ðŸ’ª
