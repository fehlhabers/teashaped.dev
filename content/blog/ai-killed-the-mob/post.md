I have been a great proponent of remote mob programming for quite a while now, creating collaborative cultures in
multiple new teams. Using git handovers and having timers to discuss how we solve different problems, keeping focus on
one thing. This has been vital for getting a team up an running, especially with a diverse team of different experience
levels. Not only for the knowledge spread, but also building culture.

However, times change. I see myself slipping away more and more from the regular mob sessions. I now have mob sessions with
AI agents instead.

## The new mob


## The new details

## Swarming

## Team Culture
I'm a bit torn in what I think of the development and how to place myself in the current landscape. Mob- and pair
programming have been my go to when starting new teams and to create a collaborative environment. There have been more
and less productive sessions, but I have always had the feeling that I can be away from work and someone else in the
team knows what needs to be done if something happens.
