Granted, it's been a while.

In some way I see that as a good thing and on the other I would want to have done more. Because I have done so much the
last year and a half that it would be have been an interesting ride journey to follow! But that's the thing; sometimes
it's also best to be able to focus on the thing at hand, that writing lengthy blog posts about it isn't the best spent time.

What you normally don't see about all stories is that there is always limited time. I'm not the kind of person that has
unlimited energy, even if I'm normally quite energetic when there is something that catches my interest. Like everyone,
I need rest and to prioritize my time. I chose to simply not use social media or do any blog updates for a while. There
was enough new things anyway.
