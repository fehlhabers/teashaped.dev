**How do I read this page?**
All of the areas, services and formats can be usually be combined in different ways, but are at the same time only examples of what I offer. If you have a proposal, please [contact me](/contact)!

## Areas of expertise

{{< tabs items="System Design & Cloud,Services,Agile & DevOps,CI/CD & GitOps,Building Teams,Ensemble/Mob" >}}
{{< tab >}}
I have long experience in designing complex solutions, ranging from automated warehouses, high traffic systems & large scale migrations. At the same time the technology stack has ranged from monolithic, to micro services - both containerized & serverless.
I have intimate know-how of AWS & Azure - enough to make a difference when building a cloud solution!

I'm happy to have worked with a bunch of different programming languages during my years. From PL/SQL to Java to Golang, but also much scripting like Python and Bash. C# & JavaScript are also there. I think you should use the right language for the job!

It's important to me that the team I work in has a great sense of ownership and works towards making small changes and often. Coaching teams to deploying quickly to production, to work together with stakeholders & how to build trust are some examples of what I mean with this.

I've built numerous CI/CD systems at this point and been integrating many popular platforms. I coach in how to work with trunk based development & GitOps and how to be able to achieve this. Versioning Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), working with desired state, security & much more.

An effective and self-organizing team makes a lot of difference in an organization! Over the years I have found patterns which repeat itself in teams that are successful and I know how to make most teams go towards this. It could be things like setting up common tools, working in pairs, experimenting, bringing up hard topics, concretely increase psychological safety.

In the last couple of years I have been working most of my time in either ensembles or pairs when working in teams. It increases the learning ability of the team tremendously, but it is not without it's challenges. I know what the pitfalls are and can help most to get into a flow which works for most.

## Example formats

{{< tabs items="Residency,Team Boost,Coaching,Workshops & Dojos" >}}
{{< tab >}}
A residency is typically a period of 1-2 months where a team has a specific area to get through and where I can bolster the team during the period. This could for example be that some new ground is broken, that the team is in disarray and needs a reset, a big technical challenge is ahead.

A residency might sometimes be hard to plan in on short notice due to availability, but there is also an option for part time work - especially if remote.

A team boost is essentially a longer term assignment in a team where I put full-time. This is my most common setup and also gives a long term effect where I have the time to get involved in the team and organization to use my skills and engagement fully! I love working together in a team and leverage the skills and experience that is in the team!
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab >}}
Coaching can typically be done part time during a longer period. This could be for one or many teams that need either technical guidance or guidance in way-of-working such as DevOps & agile principles, how to do ensemble programming and such.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab >}}
This entails preparation & facilitation for workshops & dojos. Could be to teach techniques in different programming languages in a TDD dojo with teams, or teaching how to build CI/CD or work with Infrastructure-as-Code where participants learn by building.

## Where can I work?
{{< tabs items=Remote,Physical >}}
    {{< tab >}}My way of working focuses a lot on sustainable remote teams with high collaboration, which enables engaged distributed teams. *I always use professional audio & video equipment to minimize friction during remote work.*

I'm offering my services to companies which operate within the UTC timezone whereabouts.
