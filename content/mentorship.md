I'm currently offering **2 mentorship positions**, starting in January 2025!

## About the mentor
See more about the mentor Kaj Fehlhaber in the [about section](../about)!

## Eligible adepts

- Adepts should be early in their career or just started out
- There are no academic requirements
- There needs to be a drive and purpose behind seeking mentorship
- The adept speaks Swedish or English

*That's it!* ðŸ™Œ

Candidates will be selected based on how well they match requirements.

## The setup

- We meet physically in **Gothenburg** about once per month
  - Of course also virtual if the need arises ðŸŽ¤
- We discuss meaningful topics around the needs you have
- We together devise assignments to do between meetings

My aim is that you will be able to grow as a professional within this year and harness my experience, while I will learn
from you as an adept.
