In the past couple of months, I've been part a journey which led us to incrementally automate more and more of a service deployed in Kubernetes.
During this period it became clear that there is a lot of talk about GitOps, but not very many hands-on, concrete, blogs and examples on the matter.

This is my attempt at contributing this area.

This will be the first part of a series of blog posts which I will be publishing where I will be building examples of real world CI/CD tooling.
The posts will follow the process of iteratively adding functionality to the pipeline. Starting with this post with not even a CI/CD, but only
building the most basic building blocks in order to be successful.

## ü§î GitOps - what is it?
In short GitOps basically means that everything that you see in the trunk (main branch) of a repository is also what is deployed.
It's much like how Kubernetes works; you specify a *desired state* and the system tries to reach this state by deploying or tearing down resources.

There are some different definitions regarding GitOps, but it usually boils down to:

üìù Infrastructure-as-Code

üîç Pull Requests to deploy changes

üöÄ Highly evolved CI/CD

And it makes perfect sense, since you want these parts to work in tandem in order to give the result you want: To deploy your service by simply
merging a pull request, automatically having it scanned for vulnerabilities and having an audit trail out-of-the box.

Unfortunately, there is no one-size fits all solution out there, so setting up a repository or multiple repositories to enable GitOps is not trivial.
Different technologies need different approaches, where CI/CD pipelines are built in a way to make a repository act as a GitOps repository.
Let's dive into an example with some concrete technologies and the challenges and solutions to them!

## üéØ Goal of the journey
The journey of this blog post series will take us through a couple of concepts and technologies. I will be using some popular tools and technologies when it comes to cloud computing,
but these are by no means the only or best way for you. They are a mix of technologies I want to explore and technologies I'm familiar with.

The setup consists of:

- *Containers* for applications
- *Github Actions* as the CI/CD base which glues all together
- *CodeQL* & *Github Advanced Security* for vulnerability scanning
- *Helm* charts to package *Kubernetes* resources
- *ArgoCD* for deploying our Helm charts
- Either *Crossplane* or *Terraform/OpenTofu* for cloud-specific resources
- All of this in a way which supports *multiple stages* and zero-downtime

This can become a quite daunting task in a complex environment, so we'll split it up in this series in order to focus on *one thing at a time*.
The focus area of the first part is therefore to just be able to create the *base flow for building containers!*

# üöÄ Let's start! 
The first objective of this journey will be to be able to have an infrastructure which supports building applications and deploying these
to different stages. This is the backbone of any GitOps setup.
What I'm talking about is of course to package your applications in a way which makes it possible to easily deploy the version of our choice
and to be able to quickly do so.

This can be done in a bunch of different ways. Maybe you use serverless functions like AWS Lambdas or VMs, but since I'm creating this with
Kubernetes in mind I will show best practices using **containers**.

## üìÅ Repository structure
There is really no special structure needed in a repository, but since I have chosen to go with a mono repository, it's important to put all
applications in directory for applications and that all applications are built in the same way. Check out [my repository](https://github.com/fehlhabers/gitops-example) for an example.

The applications do not need to be built with the same language, but it makes things easier when it comes to package management and such. As long
as the applications are containerized, we're all good!

## üì¶ The container
I've chosen to create a very simple Golang application to be the example at hand. See [the gitops-example repo](https://github.com/fehlhabers/gitops-example/apps/cruncher) for full info.
The reason I did this is to demonstrate how a container can be done very small and secure. A strength of compiled languages like Golang is that the app can be built into a single binary which can be added to `scratch`, eliminating pulling in any potential vulnerabilities in a runtime. In this case, the container weighs in at only **9MB**.

However, all languages can be containerized. It's just a matter of how much of a runtime is needed for the language. For example Java, you need a container with a JRE, for Python an interpreter, NodeJS, etc. You just pull in more dependencies which you need to scan and handle.

Disregardless
**Dockerfile using the builder pattern** 
```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN go mod download          # Downloads in separate layer for caching
RUN go build -o /bin/app .   # Build binary in builder
RUN useradd -u 10001 appuser # Create non-root user

##########################################################################
# This is the image we deploy. It *only* contains the binary and user-info

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /bin/app app
COPY --from=builder /etc/passwd /etc/passwd
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./app"]
```
*The builder has the needed parts to build the binary and copies the app & the user info in order to run as non-root*

Now that the application has all the needed setup to be a running container in a secure way, it's time to build a pipeline which can handle many of these applications.
