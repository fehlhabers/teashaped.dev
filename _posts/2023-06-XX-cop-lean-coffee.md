- Do you over and over again invent the same wheel as some other team in your organization?
- Was the answer to a hard challenge already out there in your company?
- Is it always up to the enabler/platform team to help and solve other teams issues which they could have gotten from anyone else?
- Trying to establish best practices in an area but don't know who to reach out to?

Do any of these statements feel familiar?

If so, you should probably try to take the initiative to start a Community of Practice (or CoP) in your field to engage the right people in the organization (or outside) to share their experience. In this post I will try to explain why maintaining well functional CoPs is very helpful and also my tips on creating well functional CoPs!

## But first...what is a CoP?
A CoP (or Community of Practice) is as it sounds like, a community. The goal of the CoP is for the participants to share knowledge and experience within their practice. The participants should be practitioners in the field and should be able to contribute to the community by sharing their experience and tipds. CoP is not a specific team, but concists of people with a common goal or interest. A CoP could for example be about a programming language, a specific domain or platform within your company.

You could say that CoP is like the counterpart of CoE (Center of Excellence) where a specific team gathers expert knowledge about a specific area. The CoP works the other way around and let the team drive the need and to organize between themselves.

## Should I just start one?
It is important to note that a CoP is not something that is created by some re-organization or management decision. CoP:s are created by the actual practitioners. Managers can only encourage and share about how it can be done, but to actually start a CoP requires the interest and commitment of the practitioners. With that said, a way for managers to create CoPs is by encouraging and fostering a culture which makes practitioners share and contribute.

There are some points that should be considered before starting a CoP:
- What topic will the CoP cover? Is there a broader need in the area or enough engaged practitioners? Since the CoP is community driven, the topic needs to be broad enough to fuel an interest for some time, yet specific enough for there to be a goal with the CoP.
- Find some practitioners that can serve as maintainers to get things going. This can also be done in a broad audience, but it helps to get of the ground.

The most important part is that there is actually a need and/or interest!

## Successful realization of a CoP
