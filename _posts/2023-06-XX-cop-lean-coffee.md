- Do you over and over again invent the same wheel as some other team in your organization?
- Was the answer to a hard challenge already out there in your company?
- Is it always up to the enabler/platform team to help and solve other teams issues which they could have gotten from anyone else?
- Trying to establish best practices in an area but don't know who to reach out to?

Do any of these statements feel familiar?

If so, you should probably try to take the initiative to start a Community of Practice (or CoP) in your field to engage the right people in the organization (or outside) to share their experience. In this post I will try to explain why maintaining well functional CoP:s is very helpful and also my tips on creating well functional CoP:s!

## But first...what is a CoP?
A CoP (or Community of Practice) is as it sounds like, a community. The goal of the CoP is for the participants to share knowledge and experience within their practice. The participants should be practitioners in the field and should be able to contribute to the community by sharing their experience and tips. CoP is not a specific team, but consists of people with a common goal or interest. A CoP could for example be about a programming language, a specific domain or platform within your company.

You could say that CoP is like the counterpart of CoE (Center of Excellence) where a specific team gathers expert knowledge about a specific area. The CoP works the other way around and let the teams drive the need and to organize between themselves.

Another name for a CoP is also "Guild", if you're using the Spotify namings with Squads, Tribes & Chapters.

## Should I just start one?
It is important to note that a CoP is not something that is created by some re-organization or management decision. CoP:s are created by the actual practitioners. Managers can only encourage and share about how it can be done, but to actually start a CoP requires the interest and commitment of the practitioners. With that said, a way for managers to create CoP:s is by encouraging and fostering a culture which make practitioners share and contribute.

There are some points that should be considered before starting a CoP:
- What topic will the CoP cover? Is there a broader need in the area or enough engaged practitioners? Since the CoP is community driven, the topic needs to be broad enough to fuel an interest for some time, yet specific enough for there to be a goal with the CoP.
- Find some practitioners that can serve as maintainers to get things going. This can also be done in a broad audience, but it helps to get of the ground.

The most important part is that there is actually a need and/or interest!

## Successful realization of a CoP
My experience is that for a CoP to be successful, there needs to be a common interest by enough practitioners to form a bulk and there needs to be at least a handful which would identify themselves as maintainers.
The topic and goal of the CoP is the single most important reason why a CoP fails or succeeds, but we'll consider the scenario where the topic of the CoP is needed and it's likely to succeed if it is executed properly.
First order of business is to create engagement in the community! It's very easy to fall into the pitfall of having only one or two driven participants who set the agenda, present and so forth - only to find that there is no response in the community and that the CoP dies as quickly as is was created. There is no silver bullet for creating engagement, but any thing which makes it easy to contribute is a good step.

### Lean Coffees
I have found that "Lean coffee" is a very good format when it comes to community driven meetups of different kinds (and should probably also be utilized more often in other meetings as well)! Lean Coffee is a way to have meetings where the agenda is built and prioritized by the community, thus making participants invested in the session.
Facilitation is also very straightforwards since the rules can be made very clear. Perfect when building up a maintainer group.
A Lean Coffee is normally built up in three parts. I'll present how I've conducted them in practice:

#### Gather topics
The agenda starts out empty and participants are given 5 mins to add topics to the topic board (post-its, Miro board, Google docs...). I recommend that even if there are some topics already beforehand, that these are added at the start of the meeting. This is particularly important if there is a specific group or team which are more involved than others since there is a high risk of the CoP becoming one-directional.

#### Vote & prioritize
When topics have been added, authors BRIEFLY describe their intention with the topics and possibly clarify. Then everyone votes for the topics they would like to discuss and lastly the facilitator sorts the topics by the amount of votes the topics got. This is then the agenda for the session!

#### Discuss topics
The topics are now gone through in order. The facilitator starts the timer and the topic can be discussed, presented or whatever is a fitting format for the topic.
After time is up, the facilitator asks the participants if the topic is still relevant. Participants give thumbs up or down. If majority wants to continue, the timer is reset, otherwise the topic is changed to the next in the list.
By applying this approach, the topic is kept to a relevant scope and the risk of dragging out topics by single individuals is reduced.

### Sponsorships
It might be that there is a team which has a higher responsibility in the area of the CoP than other teams. This could be a platform team, a group of architects or other constellation.
In this case, it is easy to fall to the pitfall that the CoP becomes a Q&A with that team rather than somewhere where practitioners share their work. The remedy to this is to add topics in moderation and to make sure to give time and space during discussions. These are really not specific for CoP:s, but it is very important to make everyone's contribution feel needed and that the expertise that everyone is adding is also seen.
Avoid communicating that the CoP would be hosted by the team! Make the CoP a separate matter and engage individuals which are not part of the team to get involved and build across teams.

### Easy-to-follow guidelines
It should be easy to contribute! That's what it's all about!
For the last CoP I setup, I used a Github repository (private organization, sorry!). The README held the basics about what it was about and what a CoP is. I also added simple steps on how you both facilitate and participate in a CoP.
_Github discussions is, by the way, an excellent choice for gathering topics and voting since it can sort comments on votes right away!_

It also mentions how to get involved and how to become one of the community heroes. Why is this useful?
Well, because literally anyone can take up the facilitator role during a session! It's even good that the core maintainers are not always there so the need for additional volunteers rises and thus, engagement.

## It's OK for CoP:s to die
Not all topics get the needed interest from practitioners! This is often very natural. A topic might be highly relevant during a period, be it short or long. What might happen is that there is no longer the same need. Maybe teams have now become proficient enough in an area that they do not have the same interest or need anymore? In that case, it might be time to either meet more seldom, or also decide to terminate the activity. The CoP can always be revived again if needed, but it might also be a good idea to switch topic to a more suitable one?

## Final thoughts
I just went through some aspects, both on theoretical and practical levels, on why I think that CoPs are an important part of a modern organization and some tips on how to make them successful.
It might be important to note that any type of community setup like this requires some level of maturity in the culture of self-organization and ownership of teams. Start small, make it inclusive. Even if the organization is not yet mature enough for the concept of CoP to work, it will still habe a positive impact and might help initiatives further ahead.
