Was your Corona remote work period a lonely experience with a lot of Slack messages and PR:s to reivew? Well, it doesn't need to be that bad, but let me share some experiences with working with remote mob proramming as default.
And before you say "That seems awfully inefficient, one programming and others watching!"; keep on reading! Let me share how I have been working in my two previous teams!


# The main ingredients
The main identifiers for a successful remote team in my experience has been those hat can mimic the communication bandwidth of being co-located combined with the focus of being remote. 

A high trust environment is crucial and the described approach will help in achieving it, but at the same time requires that proper attention is put in having a good environment.

_Let's go through the ingredients one by one!_
- Ensemble/pair by default
- Find the right size
- Open sessions for every groups
- Quick rotations/handovers
- High quality sound & video
- Explore what works for the team
- Effective ensembles

## Ensemble/pair by default
The first and biggest step is for the team to switch from doing pairs ad-hoc once in a while to do it by default! Pair and ensemble programming becomes the defacto standard within the team and going solo is the exception during the main work day.

There are still lot of things that we need to do on our own and we need different amount of time for solo work in the team. This can be things like reading up on something, time reporting, etc. The important part when going to ensemble by default is to _set some ground rules_. 

In my teams we've usually started our ensembles after having a daily and having solo work before that (optionally starting up a session to invite others to join).
Lunch is at a set time with a semi-fluent length and working in the ensemble until we decide to break it up to finish of for the day or to handle some business on our own.

This has worked quite well for us since we've built up a high trust environment - often experiment and reflecting in order to change when needed. My recommendation would be to start with this kind of simple setup first and then alter if needed.

## Find the right size
Ensemble/mob programming can be efficiently implemented in teams of varying sizes, but still adhere to the same restrictions as any other team i.e. best 8 or less. I have been using this method successfully in a team of 8, but also in a growing team from 2 to 5.

The way the method scales is in the ability to break out in multiple ensembles or pairs and swarm quickly and frequently.
