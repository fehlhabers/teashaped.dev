_"Jack of all trades, master of none - but oftentimes better than master of one"_

I didn't call this blog "teashaped" for nothing. I'm what you could call a full-fledged generalist. But, how come?
While I admire individuals with the tenacity to hone their specialized skills to perfection, I also know the time that is needed in order to get to that level!

### Pareto principle
While having some kind of main skill base, I often invest time in putting in some effort in understanding the fundamental and intermediate principles of neighbouring skills that I either feel are strategically important or simply because they seem fun to explore!

One such sprint could be to dive into a new programming language, some popular service, photography or some sport!
By focusing on something new during a period gives at least me a lot of energy since I don't spread to thin while still having enough progress to make it fun! If I don't see any visible benefit from my work, I tend to wrap up the sprint and take my learnings with me and move on to something else.

This has not been something I have been deliberately doing previously, but is something I've come to embrace and build upon since it has proven to be very powerful for leveraging the benefits of being a generalist, or "T-shaped".

The reason this is so powerful is because learning and mastering skills seems very similar to many other areas when looking at the [Pareto Principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), which can also be refered to as the "80/20 rule". 

_I do not have any kind of proof of this being the case, but they are rather personal reflections_

In practice, this would mean that with 20% of the effort, I would be 80% efficient with my new skill. These values are of course just only some general values, but the gist is that you can get to a quite decent level by investing some time into it, without honing only that skill. Some examples from my persona life would be: sourdough bread & photography.

### Experiment

For both these skills, I invested quite some time during periods to not only learn the basics of these skills, but also continue to more intermediate and advanced levels. When you focus on something where you see great progress and can see the result, it's easy to make it fun!
To reach quite advanced levels doesn't necessarily take such a long time - it all comes down to **experimentation!**

Daring to do it! Want to try out photography? Start out by checking out some YouTube videos on the basics, talk with friends that are good at it and start out taking pictures, using principles learned. 

Want to learn terraform? Create a mock-project or a "maybe" project that uses the technology. I recently did exactly this when investing some time in building a CI/CD with Golang, Terraform, AWS & Github Actions when creating [this project](https://github.com/kejne/fridge-mate). I will probably write some more about it later on.
