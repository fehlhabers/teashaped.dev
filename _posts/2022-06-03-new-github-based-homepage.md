I didn't want to put too much effort in creating a site, but at the same time create something that mirrors who I am.
I work a lot with teams, cloud architecture and backend functionality, but have never really had the urge to do any advanced frontend work. 

What I **do**, however, is to focus on comprehensive documentation that is close to the code. Writing short, meaningful README:s with Mermaid or PlantUml for example.

### Enter Jekyll & GitHub Pages

When I discovered [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and that it can be hosted right out of Github using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), this fit me quite perfectly! It allows me to write my homepage in Markdown and to have all the resources visible to me right in my repo!
I push my changes, and GitHub actions kick in to publish the changes. :raised_hands: 

### Git on the go!

Writing posts on my mobile also works nice! For example, this particular part of the post was done using [MGit](https://github.com/maks/MGit) &  [markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) for Android. The cover picture of me in the sun was added to the post in markor, although it probably needs some automation to be smooth. :robot:  

### Quickstart

The first thing I do when exploring something new is to check out what others have done. Examples are great for learning when backed with the proper documentation. 
I took a lot of inspiration from [SimonDosdas blog](https://github.com/SimonDosda/SimonDosda.github.io), but have otherwise kept it quite vanilla.

### Page is publicly available

The repo for this page is public, so check it out [here](https://github.com/fehlhabers/teashaped.dev) :point_left:
Have a try! You can quite easily setup your own page.
