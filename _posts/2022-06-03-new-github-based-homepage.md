I didn't want to put too much effort in creating a site, but at the same time create something that mirrors who I am.
I work a lot with teams, cloud architecture and backend functionality, but have never really had the urge to do any advanced frontend work. 

When I discovered [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and that it can be hosted right out of GitHub, this fit me quite perfectly!

The repo for this page is public, so check it out [here](https://github.com/fehlhabers/fehlhaberconsulting.se)

Writing posts on my mobile also works nice! For example, this particular part of the post was done using [mGit](https://github.com/maks/MGit) &  [markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) for Android. Can take a picture of me in the sun and add it right in markor! 

After having tried this out a bit, I'm ready to add some more about what I do and get the rest of the page up to date!
